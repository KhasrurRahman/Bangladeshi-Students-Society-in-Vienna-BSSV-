## 🧠 Tips from Students Who’ve Done It

### ✅ **1. Start Early**
Finding an apartment in Vienna takes time, especially in **August–October**. Start searching at least **2 months in advance**.

---

### ✅ **2. Be Careful with Scams**
🔴 **Never send money** before viewing the apartment or signing a contract.  
✅ Make sure the landlord provides valid **rental agreement** and **Meldezettel**.

---

### ✅ **3. Consider Shared Apartments (WG)**
Living with roommates is cheaper and helps you build social connections. Most students live in a **WG (Wohngemeinschaft)** during their studies.

---

### ✅ **4. Check for Meldezettel & Contract**
Make sure the accommodation provides:
- **Rental contract**
- **Confirmation for address registration (Meldezettel)**

You’ll need these for visa renewals, health insurance, and bank accounts.

---

### ✅ **5. Check if Utilities Are Included**
💧 Ask if the rent includes:
- Electricity
- Heating
- Internet
- Water bills

Some listings say “warm rent” (inclusive) vs. “cold rent” (exclusive).

---

### ✅ **6. Consider Location & Transport**
Use [Wiener Linien’s route planner](https://www.wienerlinien.at/) to check how long it takes to reach your university from the apartment.

---

### ✅ **7. Ask Seniors or Friends**
Reach out to seniors in the [BSSV WhatsApp Group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/LmVZz7wgJAd8Y95HYY2reQ) — many students find flats via personal recommendations.
